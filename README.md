# FOSTER.TS
###### A simple WebGL + TypeScript Game framework with an Scene/Entity/Component model.

★ **still very work in progress** ★

and am only working on this in my spare time!

## Goals
 - Simple framework I can use to make gamejam games with
 - Should work in-browser and also in Electron without much hassle on the game-end
 - Scene -> Entity -> Component structure
 - Frame-based animation
 - AABB Collision system
 - Don't care at all about being compatible with old JS as this is primarily to be used in Electron. ES6 all the waaaay
 
## Builds
 - [foster.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drazzke/foster/master/bin/foster.js) : compiled JS file
 - [foster.d.ts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drazzke/foster/master/bin/foster.d.ts) : typescript definition file to reference from your game (ex. `/// <reference path="foster.d.ts"/>`)

## Sample Games
